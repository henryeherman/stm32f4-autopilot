The goal of this project is to build an autopilot on the STM32F4-Discovery platform.  We will be building upon the base provided by https://github.com/prattmic/stm32f4-templates and are basing the autopilot around the system described in "Small Unmanned Aircraft: Theory and Practice" by Randal Beard and Timothy McLain.
